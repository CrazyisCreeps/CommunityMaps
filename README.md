Community Maps
==============

This repository contains maps created by members of the Overcast Community.

## Submission

If you are interested in submitting your map to be played on Overcast Community, please visit [Map Submissions](https://oc.tc/submissions/). The page will cover the process for submission, current map standards, and guidelines. We also recommend visiting the [`#mapmaking` channel in our Discord](https://oc.tc/discord) for assistance.

## Licensing

Thanks to the hard work of [ResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/), many of the Overcast Network classics were licensed and archived, allowing them be freely downloaded and used.

We hope to continue with this standard and will **only be accepting new maps that have the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license**. This allows servers to use them commercially (where donations and ranks exist). Read more in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
